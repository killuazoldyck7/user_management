# User Management System: Final Project üöÄ

## Overview
Welcome to the **User Management System** project, an open-source development initiative guided by Professor Keith Williams at NJIT! This project offers hands-on experience in real-world software development, focusing on user management functionalities with robust testing, QA processes, and new feature implementations.

---

## Goals and Objectives üéØ
1. **Practical Experience**: Collaborate on a production-grade codebase.
2. **Quality Assurance**: Identify and resolve bugs for a robust application.
3. **Test Coverage**: Write 10 new tests to address gaps in existing functionality.
4. **Feature Implementation**: Develop a new feature adhering to best practices.
5. **Industry Readiness**: Mimic real-world development processes and workflows.

## Completed Work ‚úÖ

### 1. **Feature: Profile Picture Upload with Minio** üåÑ  
Enhances user profile management by allowing users to upload and update their profile pictures securely using Minio.

**User Story**:  
_As a user, I want to upload and update my profile picture to personalize my account._

**Implementation**:  
- Created an API endpoint `/upload/{user_id}` to handle file uploads.
- Integrated Minio for object storage to store profile pictures securely.
- Added validation to restrict file types (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) and enforce a maximum file size.
- Resized uploaded images for consistency and optimization.
- Updated user model and response schema to include the profile picture URL.

**Optional Enhancements**:
- Default profile picture for users without an upload.
- Resizing images to a standard format.

**Unit Tests**:  
Implemented unit tests to verify:
- Successful file uploads.
- File type validation.
- File size enforcement.
- Profile picture URL updates in the user model.

### 2. **Quality Assurance (QA): Identified and Fixed 5 Issues** üêû  
| **Issue**                       | **Status** | **Details**                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Duplicate email and nickname error during bulk user creation | ‚úÖ Fixed   | Implemented validation checks for duplicate emails and nicknames during user creation.          |
| Role downgrade during email verification for non-anonymous users | ‚úÖ Fixed   | Ensured proper role checks to avoid role downgrades after email verification.                   |
| `list_users` Pagination Validation | ‚úÖ Fixed   | Added input validation for pagination parameters (skip, limit) to prevent invalid behavior.     |
| Missing user-id in email verification | ‚úÖ Fixed   | Resolved issue causing missing user ID during email verification processes.                    |
| Dependency conflicts in Python setup | ‚úÖ Fixed   | Fixed Python dependency conflicts to ensure smooth setup and deployment.                       |

**Closed Issues**:  
- [#14](#) Duplicate email and nickname error during bulk user creation  
- [#10](#) Role downgrade during email verification  
- [#8](#) Pagination validation in list_users  
- [#6](#) Missing user ID in email verification  
- [#3](#) Dependency conflicts in Python setup
